## Welcome

The OpenSnowcat Enrich is an open-source fork of Snowplow Enrich following the license changes in 2023 and early 2024. We're looking to sustain an analytics platform for the many businesses dependent on the rights granted by the original Apache v2.0 License.

OpenSnowcat Enrich provides record-level enrichment only: feeding in 1 raw Snowplow event will yield exactly 1 record out, where a record may be an enriched Snowplow event or a reported bad record.
